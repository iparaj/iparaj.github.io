I am a __Prime Minister Research Fellow__  working in the Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering at IIT Guwahati. My broad area of research is Control Systems. I have a keen interest in Aviation and presently carrying out my research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. I am trying to derive an accurate power consumption model of a UAV that can accurately predict the energy which will be consumed by it for a predefined trajectory. Further, I want to use my model in the path planning of UAVs with minimal energy consumption.
As a PMRF recipient, I want to give my country a strong research outcome so that the applicability of UAVs can be broadened for various socio-economic use cases. Apart from academics, I also take a keen interest in financial technologies, photography and occasionally make videos on YouTube.
I also enjoy teaching and travelling.
